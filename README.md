Final Report:

Description: The purpose of our site is to provide a routing map for an individual between classes here on BYU campus. A few examples of the targeted audience include freshmen, EFY students, people attending Woman’s conference or anyone wanting some help getting around BYU campus. We have implemented a number of features including: 
1.	Routing between buildings on a Google map of the campus.
2.	The ability to save a schedule and get a route for all the classes for a particular day.
3.	Show the maps of the destination building’s floor plans.
4.	Show a drop down of the buildings available to be mapped to.
5.	Display information about a particular building on campus.
6.	An email address for users to contact the developers of the site.  
7.	Display campus links.
8.	A dynamic page that will adjust for PC or mobile users.

Database Schema:

Future Work: Some of the features that we have planned to implement in the future are:
1.	Improving security on the site for users that have registered.
2.	Allow zooming on a buildings floor plan.
3.	Implement a campus tours option that would include more than just buildings (e.g. Statues)
4.	Make dedicated mobile app and improve the mobile experience.  
5.	The ability to link to BYU’s registrar’s office to authenticate and/or download a student’s schedule.
